# Travel-Guide
Finds the shortest travel duration route between two cities through the utilization of Dijkstra's algorithm.
Developed a website employing Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the most time-efficient route connecting two cities, allowing for a maximum of 1 flight, within a network of interconnected cities linked by bus and airplane routes.
Graph representation was visualized using the open source library vis.js. Each fresh problem generates a randomized network among 10 cities.
